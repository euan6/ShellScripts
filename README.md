# Shell Scripts

A few basic shell scripts for practice. The first putting a text file in reverse alphabetical order then writing it to a new file and displaying it in the terminal.
The second script prints the percent of lines that a specified grep pattern is found in a text file.
The third one loops through 1 - 10 file name fileN and outputs whether or not fileN exists or not.
